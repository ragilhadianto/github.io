              <p>
                LeBoYe began life as a graphic design firm in the late 1990s
                when the concept of graphic design was underrated in Indonesia
                and Apples were largely thought of only as fruits. Armed only
                with a first-generation Apple Macintosh, a leaky little house
                converted into an “office”, and an ageing Volkswagen, Ignatius
                Hermawan Tanzil established LeBoYe under very modest
                circumstances and during some challenging times.
              </p>
              <p>
                We grew alongside every client, in both wisdom and experience,
                and are fortunate to have customers who recognize our
                impassioned determination to differentiate ourselves by working
                harder to understand their respective businesses as if they were
                our own. No two clients are ever alike, and respectful of their
                individuality, LeBoYe always develops fresh new approaches that
                defy convention and “standard” industry formats. With every new
                assignment, LeBoYe endeavors to constantly develop designs that
                not only satisfied every client’s need and objective, but also
                to give birth to projects that communicate a new spirit and soul
                beyond the colors and every drawn line.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we are an interdisciplinary design firm specializing in
                creating image and branding identities, packaging, corporate
                communications, corporate brochures, web design, and other
                marketing collaterals. From international airlines to recognized
                fashion designers, we choose to broaden our horizons by engaging
                ourselves in a variety of projects across several business
                types.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a result, we are fortunate to have won several national and
                international awards for design excellence including awards from
                the Communications Arts, Type Director Club of New York, and the
                publication of a cover design on Novum Gerachsgraphics, West
                Germany. LeBoYe was invited to participate in several
                exhibitions in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo and Toronto
                including exihibitions “The Energy of Asian Design” together
                with 13 other well-known designers from across Asia.

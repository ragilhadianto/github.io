                  <p>Additionally, Family Lawyers are capable of assisting you with the creation of a  another premarital legal procedure. If done amicably and carefully, a prenuptial agreement is a reliable tool that can protect your family’s financial interests and welfare in case of separation. Under the provisions of Vietnamese laws, this agreement must be made in writing, then notarized or legalized, all before marriage. The terms of a prenuptial can identify shared and separate assets as well as determine the rights and obligations of each spouse to each asset post-divorce. Tactful yet methodical, you can trust that our lawyers will leave no stone unturned whilst ensuring a composed and productive discussion between you and your partner.</p>
